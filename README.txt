acceleration structure: we try to implement the acceleration structure by using the idea we have told in the class that we could use the boxes for the specific object to calculate whether it is hit or not. it should accelerate the speed of the program a lot as it supposed to be. 

for the homework, we did our best and invest a lot of time. but we still got one error that we could not fix at this time, the error is that some edges are just off by the graders and we think that is the only bug we have right now.
